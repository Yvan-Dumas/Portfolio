I am a black belt in karate and a volleyball player. These sports have taught me the discipline and team spirit that I bring to my technical projects. I am also a huge fan of Formula 1.\n\nI am currently seeking a 5-month internship abroad starting in September 2026 to develop my skills within an international team."
