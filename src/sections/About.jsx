            <p className="mt-15 px-20">I am a Computer Science engineering student at Polytech Lyon, passionate about new technologies and IT. I also like 3D modeling. <br /><br />

                Beyond coding, I love sport. I am a black belt in karate and a volleyball player. 
                These sports have taught me the discipline and team spirit that I bring to my technical projects. I am also a huge fan of Formula 1. <br /><br />

                I am currently seeking a 5-month internship abroad starting in September 2026 to develop my skills within an international team.
